Washington State Public Library closures: 2019-2021

**Abstract:**
 This project focuses on the data provided by the Washington State Library about branch libraries and their operations for 2019 - 2021. In this year, libraries were still being affected by Covid-19 closures, however these were not the only types of closures reported in the data. The visualizations of this project explore the most common reasons and regions for public library closures in the State of Washington, and also provide information on the extent of Covid-19 specific closures.
